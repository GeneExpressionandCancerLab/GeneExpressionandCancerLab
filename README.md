# Dequiedt Lab – Gene Expression & Fusion Oncogenes

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Dequiedt Lab website.  
Our lab investigates **moonlighting functions** of transcriptional factors and regulators — focusing on their unexpected roles in **post-transcriptional gene expression**.

🧪 We are particularly interested in **FET gene fusions** (e.g., EWS-FLI1) and their contribution to **Ewing sarcoma** and other cancers.
