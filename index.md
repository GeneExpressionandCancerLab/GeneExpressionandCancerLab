# Welcome to the Dequiedt Lab

We are a research team led by **Dr. Franck Dequiedt**, investigating the **moonlighting functions** of transcriptional factors and regulators â€” roles that go beyond their traditional activities in gene transcription.

Our work explores how these regulators influence **post-transcriptional processes**, including:

- **mRNA splicing**
- **mRNA stability**
- **mRNA translation**

We study these mechanisms in **developmental systems** and in the context of **cancer**, with a particular focus on gene fusions involving transcription factors.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Focus

A major model in our lab is the class of **FET (FUS, EWSR1, TAF15)** gene fusions, which are oncogenic drivers in **sarcomas and leukemias**.

Our central interest lies in the **EWS-FLI1 fusion**, which is pathognomonic of **Ewing sarcoma**, a rare and aggressive bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and young adults.

Although these fusions have been mainly studied for their transcriptional activity, our recent discoveries reveal **unexpected post-transcriptional functions** that may be critical to their oncogenic potential.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Goals

We aim to:

- Uncover how transcriptional regulators act at multiple layers of gene expression
- Integrate **transcriptional and post-transcriptional roles** of FET fusions
- Reveal novel mechanisms of oncogenic gene regulation
- Contribute to **diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic** advances for Ewing sarcoma and related cancers
